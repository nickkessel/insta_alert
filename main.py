#TODO: these are roughly (ish) in order of do first/last. simpler stuff is kinda to the top
#DONE different color warnings tor = red, svr = yellow, flashflood = green, tor-r = wideborder red, pds-tor = magenta, svr-destructive/considerable = wideborder yellow
#DONE add to header text expiration time for warning
#DONE make bigger cities have bigger labels. could probably do a few "bins" e.g. >40000 biggest font, 10000-40000 medium font, <10000 small font? trial and error, should not be too hard.
#DONEchange city label font; thinking monospace all-caps for legibility. 
#DONE change city markers; thinking "plus" signs? 
#DONE make county borders thinner, help with legibility
#DONE fix it so that it only tries to plot cities in the map region, not plot everything in the dataset then only show a small subset
# check through list of params (hailsize, windspeed, torpossible, etc) and for the ones that are present, draw in box on map in corner of view
#DONE declutter map with place names: either:
    #1) manually change csv to have only chosen places names (easier, lots of trial and error to get it good. not scalable/applicable to different locales, would have to redo it for that)
    #2) write loop that checks lat/lon of each place being plotted and if it's too close to another lat/lon, don't plot. also account for zoom level, e.g. if we're more zoomed in, the lat/lon
        #between place names can be less, and if more zoomed out, then adjust the other way, have lat/lon tolerance be larger, to plot less names. 
        #also make sure bigger cities are plotted first, so they're not accidently left out. this method is probably a lot more work up front, but once it's working should be able to be
        #applied to multiple regions wihtout much difficulty
#DONE fix error with plotting cities where some are labeled like on the edge of the map. not sure how to do this.  
                                                              
#add support for pds tor warnings and considerable/destructive svr. could be a little box below the issued time ("this is a destructive storm! this is a paticularly dangerous situation! need to see how these come across in the json")
#fix weird scaling issue with different sized warnings        
#make cities out of the polygon paler                         
#maybe declutter the map some by either keeping zoom closer to the box or having lower density of ciites
# DONE figure out why adding warning to the posted_alerts[] list still plots again 
#make it so that updates to existing warnings don't post unless there is a different geometry or parameters. 
    #use the "references" field in the json to check, maybe?  
    #for svr warnings expiring, if there is no wind/hail value, then it is a cancellation
#optimisations!! once everything is working, make it fast. cache as much as possible, especially the city names csv, only have my region cities
